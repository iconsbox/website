Hi!

I am Jafar Rezaei - also known as SayJeuHi.

I am a web developer with good focus on building frontend related stuff. If I want to give a flash back to first days of stating my work, First when I was 17y.o I made a website called CoffeMellat to design graphic, after some banner design I figure it out I could code some of my designs.
So I built MellatDesign website which aims on making re-usable templates with a focus on <a href="https://mybb.com/" target="_blank">MyBB</a>.

MellatDesign was a successful project and we did a lot of works with that brand. With starting university I register a company named Idea processor and worked on a bigger project called <a href="http://citygram.ir" target="_blank">CityGram</a>. That was a project like <a href="https://yelp.com" target="_blank">yelp</a>. We worked in <a href="http://www.iauardabil.ac.ir/index.aspx" target="_blank">Roshd accelerator of Azad university in Ardabil</a>. After two years of work on Citygram our team failed and we
decide to work on a new project called <a href="http://jurchin.com" target="_blank">Jurchin</a>. Jurchin was a website maker with focus on drag&drop components to page. After one year of working on it we decide to close the company and keep a regular life without stress of failing every day.

Then in 2017 I move from Ardabil to Tehran and my employee independent life started. I worked for <a href="https://torfehnegar.com/" target="_blank">Torfehnegar</a>, and then now in 2020 I am at SnappMarket

I like javascript and wrote a book to make learning it easier,
it is open source and available in <a href="http://mariotek.ir" target="_blank">Mariotek</a> repository [ <a href="https://github.com/Mariotek/BetterUnderstandingOfJavascript" target="_blank">github</a> ]. I also translate a book about reactjs interview questions which could help people
to have easier interviews [ <a href="https://github.com/Mariotek/reactjs-persian-interview-questions" target="blacnk">github</a> ].
